// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Enter first nNum1
Enter second nNum2
Calculate= First nNum1 + Second nNum2
Display the result of the sum 
End

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Enter a number
If number divisible by 2 print "number is even"
else print "number is odd"



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   

nNum1- accept input
nNum2- accept input
nNum3- accept input
nNum4- accept input
nNum5- accept input


b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

Add all numbers= nNum1+ nNum2+ nNum3+ nNum4+ nNum5
Divide total by 5
Display the result


c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

Smallest amount(min) between nNum1; nNum2; nNum3; Nnum4; nNum5
Largest amount (max) between nNum1; nNum2; nNum3; nNum4; nNum5


d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Display "Sum of all 5 nNumbers"
Display nNum "largest amount"
Display nNum "smallest amount"
